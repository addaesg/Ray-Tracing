The diagram is a UML diagram used to design the ray casting software. It is interpreted like so: each node represents a procedure, class, or interface the software needs to implement. If a node B points to node A, then implementing A requires first implementing B, so that A uses the abstractions provided by B. The blue node, at the bottom, is the goal procedure of the software. Green nodes have no other implementation requirements, meaning they can be readily coded from an empty project.
